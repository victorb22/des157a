            <p>Some questions I have about my Every Picture Project are mostly on interactions 
                involving my image and overlays I plan to use. I want to do a click, zoom, and overlay 
                on my image and already have an idea on how to do it. So far, I have the overlay and 
                click working, but I still need to implement the zoom functionality. My main image
                on my site is a map so I want to zoom into each spot when clicked. I am planning
                to review the week 6 lecture slides to help me create this as I did the same with 
                coding the div click interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another idea I want to implement and still need to review the slides is how to make
                a slideshow type of interaction. I have various pictures of 5 different locations I 
                plan to include so I think the best method would be a clickable slideshow. For this,
                I plan to also review the week 6 lecture slides and if I find myself struggling I 
                will reach out to the teaching staff.
