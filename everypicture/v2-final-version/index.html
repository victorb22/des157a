            Before going on this trip, a small background on my family, specifically my mom's side. Her and my dad
            came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2001. Luckily for my dad, all of his siblings already lived in the same city in the East Bay called
            Concord. I grew up in California and didn't get to know my mom's side of the family as they all lived in Mexico. 
            I got the opportunity to go to Mexico last year and meet some of my uncles, my grandma, and cousins for the first time. Unfortunately my grandpa
            passed away when I was about four, but Iâ€™m often told that I have hair similar to his since curly hair runs in my family. Here are a few photos of him, my mom, and her family. The 
            following pins after are from my trip to visit this family at my grandpa's house in the town of El Rincon, Jalisco. As well as a small day trip we took to two nearby cities, Mazamitla and Zapotlan. 
            Along this trip my uncle Ruben from my mom's side accompanied my mom and I to all of these places and you'll most likely notice him in a few of the pictures.

        <p>
            These are pictures from the town my family comes from and where we were staying. While there, I captured
            images of things I saw and often encountered. Such as going to go drink fresh cow's milk every morning,
            dogs out in the streets, going out with my cousins, using the bus to move around, and experiencing how the entire 
            town gathers to celebrate and parade for Holy Week.

        <h2>Grandpa's House</h2>

        <p>
            During my trip, we stayed at my grandpa's house that he left his family behind in El Rincon, Jalisco. My mom was born in Apatzingan, Michoacan and raised there in their primary family home; since my grandpa owned a welding shop in that town that my uncles now own.
            And so this second house served as a vacation home to my mom's family growing up as they would come visit family we also have in El Rincon. It's also where my dad was born and raised and actually met my mom during one of her family visits.
            Luckily, it's a fairly large house and I was able to stay there with a few of my aunts, cousins, and grandma. In Mexico, it is common for people to 
            stay up late and spend time with family. Every night we played a Mexican card game called 'Loteria' and accompanied it with coffee, chatting, and 
            late night snacks that we would often get from corner stores or food vendors that would sell in the town's center plaza. That is the first image, we would gather around the dinner table to hangout and chat every night. This is one of the biggest things I miss about Mexico, and being in a small pueblo like El Rincon. The other pictures
            are from the outside of the house. Some of them are of me and my cousins, uncle, mom and grandma; and the others are of my mom and her family.

        <h2>Mazamitla and Zapotlan, Jalisco</h2>

        <p>
            About an hour from where we were staying in El Rincon was another town called Mazamitla. The name derives from Nahuatl language
            and is a combination of words meaning "deer" and "place". That's why there are deer related items around the town and in the pictures. Zapotlan
            was another town we stopped at on the way home that is about 20 minutes from El Rincon. It is a larger, more urban town that has a lot of nice architecture and stores to shop at. The first and last 3 images are taken from Zapotlan.

        <h2>Dad's Parcela</h2>

        <div>
            <img src="./images/pin5-image1.png" alt="Dad's Land in MX" id="gettingTh5" width="500" height="550">

        <p>
            A 'parcela' is plot or plot of land in Spanish, and my dad left one behind before leaving to the U.S. My uncle who 
            visits regularly and also has a house nearby takes care of the land and a few animals he has there for himself. The pictures I 
            took are of the path leading to there that I walked with my uncle, some crops that are nearby, a coconut tree I passed, and some 
            pictures of the land. It's a pretty big piece of land at the base of a large mountain and surrounded by natural environment. I enjoyed
            visiting it and hope to help my dad do something with it someday.
