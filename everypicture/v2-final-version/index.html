            Before going on this trip, a small background on my family, specifically my mom's side. Her and my dad
            came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2001. Luckily for my dad, all of his siblings already lived in the same town in the East Bay called
            Concord. I grew up in California and didn't get to know my mom's side of the family as they all lived in Michoacan, Mexico. 
            I got the opportunity to go to Mexico last year and meet some of my uncles, my grandma, and cousins for the first time. Unfortunately my grandpa
            passed away when I was about four, but I'm always told I have similar features as him. And here are just a few photos of him and my mom and her family that I cherish. The 
            following pins after are from my trip to visit this family at my grandpa's house in El Rincon, Jalisco, and a small day trip we took to the city of Mazamitla which is about an hour away from where we were.

            These are pictures from the town my family comes from and where we were staying. While there, I captured
            images of things I saw and often encountered. Such as going to go drink fresh cow's milk every morning,
            dogs out in the streets, going out with my cousins, using the bus to move around, and experiencing how the entire 
            town gathers to celebrate and parade for Holy Week.

            During my trip, we stayed in my grandpa's house that he left behind. Luckily, it's a fairly large house and
            I was able to stay there with a few of my aunts, cousins, and grandma. In Mexico, it is common for people to 
            stay up late and spend time with family. We often played a Mexican card game called 'Loteria' and accompanied it with coffee and 
            snacks. That is the first image, we would gather around the dinner table to hangout and chat every night. The other pictures
            are from the outside of the house. Some of them are of me and my cousins, uncle, mom and grandma; and the others are of my mom and her family.
