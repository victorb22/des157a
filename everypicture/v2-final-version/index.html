            Before going on this trip, a small background on my family, specifically my mom's side. Her and my dad
            came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2001. Luckily for my dad, all of his siblings already lived in the same town in the East Bay called
            Concord. I grew up in California and didn't get to know my mom's side of the family as they all lived in Michoacan, Mexico. 
            I got the opportunity to go to Mexico last year and meet some of my uncles, my grandma, and cousins for the first time. Unfortunately my grandpa
            passed away when I was about four, but I'm always told I have similar features as him. And here are just a few photos of him and my mom and her family that I cherish. The 
            following pins after are from my trip to visit this family at my grandpa's house in El Rincon, Jalisco, and a small day trip we took to the city of Mazamitla which is about an hour away from where we were.
