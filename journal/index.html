            <h2>Post 1 - Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date class="date">01/21/2025</date>
            <p>After reading the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> on best practices for form design, I took away several valuable lessons about putting the user 
            first. As UI/UX designers, we are often designing for a broad audience when creating a public website or form. So, we must take 
            into consideration the most effective ways to maintain user engagement, boost usability and design for accessibility. I have 
            created forms before, so looking over this article served as a checklist for me to see what I was doing a good job with and what 
            I could improve upon. Forms can be tedious to fill out, so by using the practices mentioned in the article, such as providing a 
            number of steps, minimizing input fields, providing feedback and labeling, we can make them easier to complete and straightforward 
            for the user. As well as, thinking about factors that impact accessibility such as color contrast, allowing users to change text size, 
            and designing for screen readers. </p>

            <p>As part of a UI/UX internship, I had to interact a lot with <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/sign-up/#/?src=b2b-marketing-header">Glassdoor's Employer Form</a> for creating an account. I believe they
             demonstrate best practices for design since they always use labels, differing sizes of boxes for input fields depending on 
             character count, and always giving form feedback. Additionally, their color contrast is made with accessibility in mind and uses 
             primary, secondary, tertiary, and disabled buttons to give additional feedback.</p>
