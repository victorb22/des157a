            <h2>Post 3 - Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <date class="date">02/11/2025</date>
            <p>After reading the article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</a> 
                article, I found that practicing visual thinking skills to be very beneficial. As seen with students of all ages, it can help with deeper thinking and paying close attention 
                to detail. As designers, specifically UI/UX designers, we get the opportunities to create visual landscapes and environments that users can explore through a website or app. 
                And paying attention to details such as context within what you’re creating and how you can incorporate interactions and images to give off a certain feeling or brand to website/app visitors. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, I looked at <a href="https://www.fontevraud.fr/decouvrir-fontevraud/">Fontevraud’s website</a>, it is a historic abbey in France that offers museum visits and a hotel and restaurant. 
                The imagery and interactions they use feel very immersive and make you feel like you can look into the images with how they move and expand. I think using creative interactions like this that makes 
                sense with what you’re making is always a good practice, but also think that having too many interactions can be overwhelming. Which is what I felt could potentially be the case with some users with this site.

            <h2>Post 2 - Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <date class="date">01/30/2025</date>
            <p>The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</a> 
                provides important insight on how to best design modal interfaces for users. As designers, it’s important to provide clear options for our users. 
                This includes, taking into account focus, readability, clear navigation, and screen space. A modal should have a title, clearly labeled buttons/navigation, 
                and only appear in response to specific user interactions. The article also gave a great tip that I had never thought about, which was avoiding using modals 
                and overlays on mobile screens since the screen sizes are too small and wouldn’t really work. Also, thinking about accessibility and keyboard navigation as it 
                is common for users to use buttons such as escape to navigate through pages. By following these best practices, we can design better user experiences and reduce 
                annoyances users come across.

            <h2>Post 1 - Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date class="date">01/21/2025</date>
            <p>After reading the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> on best practices for form design, I took away several valuable lessons about putting the user 
            first. As UI/UX designers, we are often designing for a broad audience when creating a public website or form. So, we must take 
            into consideration the most effective ways to maintain user engagement, boost usability and design for accessibility. I have 
            created forms before, so looking over this article served as a checklist for me to see what I was doing a good job with and what 
            I could improve upon. Forms can be tedious to fill out, so by using the practices mentioned in the article, such as providing a 
            number of steps, minimizing input fields, providing feedback and labeling, we can make them easier to complete and straightforward 
            for the user. As well as, thinking about factors that impact accessibility such as color contrast, allowing users to change text size, 
            and designing for screen readers. </p>

            <p>As part of a UI/UX internship, I had to interact a lot with <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/sign-up/#/?src=b2b-marketing-header">Glassdoor's Employer Form</a> for creating an account. I believe they
             demonstrate best practices for design since they always use labels, differing sizes of boxes for input fields depending on 
             character count, and always giving form feedback. Additionally, their color contrast is made with accessibility in mind and uses 
             primary, secondary, tertiary, and disabled buttons to give additional feedback.</p>
